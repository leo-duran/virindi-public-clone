These source files are designed to assist plugin developers in the use of the
Virindi View Service.

The Wrapper*.cs files contain a set of classes which abstract the concept of
an AC view provider, allowing a plugin to easily switch between Decal views
and Virindi Views.

ViewSystemSelector.cs contains a class which detects the presence of the
Virindi View System, which allows a plugin to use VVS when it is available
but fall-back to normal Decal views when it is not. The View System Selector
returns classes implementing the MetaViewWrapper interfaces.

The AddonControls directory contains additional controls, built on the
MetaViewWrappers, which may be useful. They are designed to provide the same
interface whether created with Decal or Virindi views.

The ViewWrapperCodeGenerator directory contains a simple utility to assist
in coding plugins which use the view wrappers. It takes as input a view .xml
file and outputs C# code defining common UI element classes, as well as
initialization and disposal functions. NOTE: By default, the output code must
be modified to specify your .xml's source.
